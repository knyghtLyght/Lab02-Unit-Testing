# unit test ATM

A small app intended to explore unit testing.

## Getting Started

This is a small test app using visual studio 2017. 
You will also need xunit testing. 
You will need to install and run VS2017 in order to run and use the app.

## Features

This app emulates an AYM with balance check, deposit and withdraw features. Their is basic error checking to prevent a negetive balance but not much more. There is also basic exception handeling.

## Resources and Links

I worked with Amanda Iverson.

I also leveraged Stack overflow and the 7.0 in a nutshell publication.
